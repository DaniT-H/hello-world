# hello-world
This is my introduction to the programming world!
I'm a geoscience student with an agricultural technology internship. It'll be my job to crunch all of the image data we have collected from monitoring alfalfa plants with various sensors (along with a lot of other little side data!) This is really exciting for me to learn, but super hard to dive into.
